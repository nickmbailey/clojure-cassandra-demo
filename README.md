# clojure-cassandra-demo

A basic last.fm clone to demonstrate using Apache Cassandra with Clojure.

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

 * First you need to install CCM
  * https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm
 * You'll also need a last.fm api key
  * http://www.last.fm/api

 1. Start a 3 node CCM cluster (see ccm docs)
 1. Run
    > export LASTFM_API_KEY="<your api key"
 1. run
    > lein ring server

### Things that could be improved

 * Use prepared statements
 * The counter cfs aren't particularly realistic. Include spark in the demo for periodically generating counts/analytics maybe?
 * UI
  * Add colors or something
  * Use CSS instead of HTML 1 style tags
 * Probably lots more.
